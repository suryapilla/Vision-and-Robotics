# Orientation-Tracking-and-Panoramic-image-generation

Step 0:>>> Place all these scripts in the same directory

Step 1:>>> First install the requirement files in new environmnet: pip install requirements.txt

Step 2:>>> utilsCam and utils files have all the relevant functions required for the main function

Step 3:>>> setup the path as per the config.yml file in config directory

Step 4:>>> For training run the main function by giving the correct path to the data folder

Step 5:>>> There are 3 sections in the main.py script:

	1 >>> Object tracking part

	2 >>> Plotting the roll, pitch and yaw for VICON, Unoptimized and Optimized data
	
	3 >>> Panorama generation
	
Step 6:>>> For testing run testMain.py script, with correct test data directory in path

Step 7:>>> This if for testing data where VICON data is not available, the flow is similar to the main.py
	
	1 >>> Object tracking part
	
	2 >>> Plotting the roll, pitch and yaw for Unoptimized and Optimized data
	
	3 >>> Panorama generation
